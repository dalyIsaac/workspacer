NOTE: This fork is maintained by @dalyIsaac. It is up to date with [workspacer/workspacer](https://github.com/workspacer/workspacer), with various pending PRs merged in.

As workspacer has transitioned to the [workspacer](https://github.com/workspacer) GitHub organization, PRs are now being reviewed and merged in.

Forking off [dalyIsaac/workspacer](https://github.com/dalyIsaac/workspacer/) is not recommended, as the `main` branch will regularly be rebased off [workspacer/workspacer](https://github.com/workspacer) and be force-pushed to.

When a PR is merged into upstream, `main` on this fork will be rebased. The rebase should:

1. Remove the existing commit from `main`
2. Bring in the merged pull request
